Hello!

I’m neither a sysadmin nor a software engineer but parts of both.

I love talking about infrastructure, scalability, distributed systems, DevOps culture (<3), GNU/Linux, and
Free/Libre Open-Source Software.
These days I mainly end up hacking in Python, but I’ve also dabbled in Go, C, C++ and Java.

I currently work for Facebook as a Production Engineer on PE Virtualization Infra, and have previously worked for
[Ensighten](https://ensighten.com/), [Google](https://google.com), [PageFair](https://pagefair.com/), and
[Trinity College, Dublin](https://tcd.ie/).

I was an active member of Trinity College’s Internet Society, [Netsoc](http://netsoc.ie/) while in college, where I
was mainly a sysadmin.

My other interests include [high-end and vintage mechanical computer keyboards](https://deskthority.net), video games
(though that’s a pretty generic interest in 201X), and cooking.

For more info, check out my [work](work) section, recent posts, or look through my [GitHub](https://github.com/scottcunningham).
