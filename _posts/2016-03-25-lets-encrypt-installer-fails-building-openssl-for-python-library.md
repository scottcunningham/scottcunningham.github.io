When upgrading my Let's Encrypt SSL cert on my tiny DigitalOcean VM recently, I ran into an annoying error: the installer would get to installing Python dependencies, reach M2Crypto (a pretty awkward wrapper around OpenSSL, but unfortunately with no better alternative) and fail with the following error:

```

Argh! It turns out that this error message doesn't provide us with much juicy context, as I found out when I encountered it. The important part is near the end:

```
x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1)
```

Hmm, I thought. Must be the kernel! I only had about 250 megabytes of memory left, so I tried stopping a few non-critical but memory-heavy services (like Redis for my Hubot) and luckily, that saved me â€” it was just a lack of free memory. But what could you do it that wasn't possible?

One option, while possibly quite slow, would be to create a temporary swapfile. Thankfully Digital Ocean's small VMs use SSDs so it's not the end of the world:

```
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/swapfile bs=1024 count=524288
sudo chmod 600 /path/to/swapfile
sudo mkswap /path/to/swapfile
sudo swapon /path/to/swapfile
```

And once you're done, you can remove it:

```
sudo swapoff /path/to/swapfile
sudo rm /path/to/swapfile
```

Nice!
